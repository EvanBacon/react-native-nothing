# React for Absolutely Nothing

> AKA: React zen mode

A universal React renderer for absolutely nothing. Inspired by the React Conf talk about building a [custom renderer for React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGpMlWVcHok). 

Conceptually the host environment is nothing.

## 🔨 Setup

```
yarn
```

## 🏁 Example

To see nothing in action, run `node example`!

- Nothing will happen.

## ⚽️ Usage

Create JSX that renders to nothing. See [example](./example/index.js)
